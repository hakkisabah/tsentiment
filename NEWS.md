# tsentiment 1.0.0

* Major changes have been made for `policy clauses` throughout.
* For an easier use, a service that acts as a middleware and includes a twitter application has been written. Thanks to this service, only a regular Twitter account is sufficient instead of the developer account requirement.
* Progress bar has been added to make it easier to understand while transactions are taking place.
